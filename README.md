## Implementing A.I. Tree Searches (Simulated Annealing + Backtracking)
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gigamatt/ai-room-scheduleing/master/img/readme_image.png)

## About
Built in Java, the _AI Room Scheduling_ project implements more of the fundamental search methods used for problem solving in artificial intelligence, and to expand on utilizing heuristicss for improving search. In this project, we experiment with a basic formulation of the class scheduling problem. 

_Tree Search + Pathfinding_ is a midterm project by Matthew Montoya & Hiram Rios for UTEP's Artificial Intelligence, CS 4320.

## How To Compile/Run
1. Open the directory to **/ai-room-scheduling/**
2. Execute jar file by typing in: **java -jar homework.jar** <your-six-paramters>

Alternatively, the _.java_ files may be imported into your IDE and run locally

## Dependancies
1. Java 8 or later
2. Microsoft Windows 7 or later or macOS High Sierra or later
